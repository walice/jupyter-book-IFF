Unsupervised Machine Learning on Illicit Trade Activity
============================

This Jupyter Book contains my final project for PSTAT 234.

This project works with the latest estimates of trade-based illicit financial flows produced by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). I developed those estimates with my colleagues Gamal Ibrahim and William Davis.

We are currently writing up the manuscript, and the methodology to generate those estimates is subject to change. I ask that you please not share this project beyond our class.
